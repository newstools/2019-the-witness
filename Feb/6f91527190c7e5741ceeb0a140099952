An SPCA inspector on Monday had to jump inside a stormwater drain to rescue a German Shepherd that had most likely been stuck there for about a day. The healthy-looking tan-coloured dog was freed from the storm­water drain on Mars Crescent in Northdale on Monday when SPCA inspector Udesh Kumar went down a manhole after failing initially to coax the dog out. The dog was passed up from inside the stormwater drain to concerned resident Niven Maharaj, who had called the SPCA on Monday morning. Maharaj, whose house is near the manhole, told The Witness: “My dogs were going crazy this morning and we came to check what was happening outside. “We saw this dog inside the manhole and tried to coax it out but it didn’t work. I fed it some dog chunks but she wasn’t drinking the water we left.” Maharaj assumed the dog had crawled into the stormwater drain during the heavy storm on Sunday night, perhaps searching for shelter. Kumar said the dog appeared to be healthy and was unscathed, but was a bit worked up and restless after its ordeal. The dog was not aggressive during the rescue operation. He said the dog was taken back to the SPCA where it would be examined by a vet and checked for a microchip to locate a potential owner. Kumar said the dog may be put on a drip for nutrition. “We will check our lost and founds to see whether there were any reports of this kind of dog. She’s not underweight and she has been sterilised — this shows that she probably has an owner.”  SPCA field officer Mlungisi Sibiya with the dog after it was rescued. He said the dog did not appear sick and had no injuries. He believed the chances of getting her rehomed were good. “If no one comes forward within seven days to claim her, we will put her up for adoption. Anyone who lost a dog in the Northdale area­ recently should come forward. “We appeal to people to fence their properties and be vigilant of their dogs’ whereabouts.”
