When Gauteng businessman Calvin Mutwanamba learnt about the plight of a family of 12 sharing a single shack in Hopewell, he was so touched that he caught the next flight to Pietermaritzburg to rescue them. Mutwanamba, who visited the Sangweni family last week, has pledged to build the family a decent house. “I grew up very poor and when I saw the picture of this family on social media I was moved. As we speak, I have already made arrangements with builders, who have assured me that it will take three weeks to build the house,” he said. Zinhle Sangweni (32) who shares the shack with her nine kids, mother and brother, burst into tears on learning that a Good Samaritan has responded to the plight of the family. “There is no one working in the family. The father of my children, who had been assisting us with groceries, died two years ago. We were hoping that he would build us a house. “We tried applying for a government house but so far we have not been able to get any,” she said. Mutwanamba said: “I’m doing this purely out of sympathy for the family. Even the actual building of the house ... there won’t be any intermediaries. I will be personally involved to ensure that politics plays no part in the project,” he said. The majority of residents of Hopewell township, which falls under the Richmond Municipality, are farm labourers working on nearby farms. Crime and higher poverty levels have come to characterise the township, with several residents having been retrenched due to challenges in the agricultural sector ranging from drought to high production costs.
