“No, I’ve had enough, I don’t see myself going there. I don’t want anything that associates me with it [the Reed Dance],” says 13-year-old Lungelo Mthethwa, one of the survivors of the minibus taxi accident that happened in Pomeroy on Saturday night. She and several other girls and women were coming from a Reed Dance preparation camp filled with singing and dancing. In extreme pain and gasping for breath, Mthethwa described the accident to The Witness, saying the driver was driving recklessly at a high speed. “We pleaded with him not to speed but he told us that he has been driving for a long time and that he is experienced.” Mthethwa added that the other girls in the minibus warned the driver that the bridge was not stable enough to handle a speeding car but he dismissed their fears. The driver then reportedly lost control of the minibus taxi causing it to roll and land on its roof. A fire started from the back of the vehicle, trapping the passengers inside. Mthethwa was sitting behind the driver, something which she believes saved her life. She recalls shouting and screaming when she realised the bus had caught alight but doesn’t remember who rescued her from the minibus, or how. It’s only when they got to Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg yesterday that she and her family discovered that she had several broken bones, in addition to burns on her legs and buttocks. “Some [of the girls] are burnt on their faces and others couldn’t get out. “I’ve lost my friends but I’m thankful that I didn’t get burnt too badly,” said the tearful teen. What distresses her the most, however, is that it was not her first time going to the camp but this tragic incident will make it her last.
