The historic Buchanan Street baths in the centre of the city
are ready for summer, but swimmers are concerned that other public pools will
remain closed after the start of the swimming season. Dintle Kubheka, the supervisor at the Buchanan Street baths,
said they were ready to welcome bathers as maintenance at the pool, which
opened two weeks ago, was already complete. The Concerned Swimming Fraternity’s Jay Jugwanth said on Monday,
however, that with only a three weeks left, the fraternity were not optimistic
that the maintenance and rehabilitation works at other city pools would be
finished by September 1. “The swimming pools never open on time because of poor
planning by the Msunduzi parks and recreation department during the winter
season. We have three weeks before the pools open and very little has been
done,” said Jugwanth. He said the local swimming fraternity had put pressure on
the municipality over the years, to ensure that all repairs were conducted
during the winter months, so that there would be an uninterrupted summer
swimming season. Jugwanth said at the Olympic pool in Newholmes, they had
requested to change to gas chlorine to keep the water in a decent state, but
“the municipality is still using chlorine granules”. He said the shortage of lifeguards also remained a concern. “We want a lifeguard for every 200 bathers as per
regulation. We also need to make sure that all the lifeguards’ qualifications
have been updated and that they have done the recent swimming proficiency
tests,” he said. He said the Eastwood pool was also in a bad state, adding
that the community was partly to blame for the vandalism. Jugwanth said there have long been issues with the Alexandra
pool filtration system. “We have long asked the municipality to set aside politics
and call on the expertise of people who have worked in pools in the past,”
Jugwanth said. The Witness has run several reports about the range of
problems at Pietermaritzburg’s pools.
