A burglar was electrocuted on Monday while trying to exit the roof of a shop in the CBD. Teshome Paulos, owner of TP General Trading on Church Street, made the discovery and notified the police on Monday morning. Paulos, who lives in the same building, said when he went to open his shop at about 5.15 am he heard someone crying out for help on the roof. A nervous Paulos said he woke up his neighbours and then called the police. He suspects that when the teenager tried to get out of the roof, he was electrocuted. When he opened the shop, the teenager was still alive. “He was still moving around although he didn’t say anything. We called the police and they got here about 15 minutes later and he was dead,” he said. He said the teenager was found with items he had stolen from the shop, including a laptop, jacket and sandals. He said they suspect that the teenager and his accomplices had used a concrete bin to enter the shop through the roof. “It’s happened before. They came back on Monday and unfortunately this time around he was unlucky,” he said. KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of burglary and an inquest were opened at Pietermaritzburg SAPS for investigation. Russel Meiring said ER24 paramedics were called to the scene at around 6.30 am. “ER24 medics climbed into the ceiling and found the motionless boy lying inside the ceiling. Search and rescue services had to cut away part of the roof to gain access to the man.” Meiring said the man suffered burn wounds to his arms.
