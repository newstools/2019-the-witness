Msunduzi Municipality has intensified checks in industrial areas for factory effluent in the sewers. Last week, Truda Snacks and Trucking Rebuild Specialists were confronted by the municipality for discharging effluent into the sewers. Msunduzi water and sanitation’s Brenden Sivpersad said when industrial effluent is discharged into a sewer system it mixes with everything else in the line at various points. “If the sewer surcharges and we discover trade effluent, we are unsure where this entered the system. “We have inspectors who patrol and check sewer systems on a daily basis, especially along streams. “The structure caters for sewer inspectors and the business unit will be prioritising this in the current financial year.” He added that the municipality also has an agreement with Duct (Duzi-uMngeni Conservation Trust) “who offer great assistance in monitoring sewer systems along river embankments”. Sivpersad said they receive compliance reports from Umgeni Water who undertake the sampling and analysis every month to try to ensure factories are complying with the municipal by-laws on disposing of chemicals, engine fluid, paint and so on. “There is always room for improvement with respect to sampling and this is predominantly resource-driven within the municipality. “It should be noted that equal onus must be placed with factory owners to conduct their business in a responsible manner and within the by-laws,” he said.
