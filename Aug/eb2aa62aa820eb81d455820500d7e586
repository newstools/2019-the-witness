A weekend of violence left six people dead in the Esigodini area in Edendale. Four men and two women were shot and killed in separate incidents in the area on Saturday night. The violence is allegedly linked to a bloody taxi war that has been raging in the area for more than two years. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said in the first incident, which happened at about 6 pm, a 43-year-old man died after being shot in the head and back. Forty-five minutes later, three more people were killed when a trio of gunmen entered a shop and opened fire. Then, at around 8 pm, a 25-year-old woman was gunned down in her home, and a 24-year-old man was shot multiple times in another part of Esigodini. Cases of murder have been opened at the Plessislaer police station. A source, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Witness the murders were linked to ongoing taxi violence in the area. “There is lawlessness in the area and the police are not doing anything. They [police] know that this is going on, but they are failing to arrest the perpetrators,” he said. The source, who survived an assassination attempt in 2017, said he suspected that illegal taxi operators, who are demanding to be allowed to operate in the area without permits, are behind the recent murders. “We are living in fear because we don’t know who is next. I have asked the police to place me under witness protection twice ... it hasn’t happened,” the source said. KZN Transport, Community Safety and Liaison spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda is planning to meet with SAPS management today in connection with the murders.
