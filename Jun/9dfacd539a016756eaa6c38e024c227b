Police are investigating a case against a well-known Pietermaritzburg security company owner after he allegedly instructed two security guards to barricade his wife inside their home. A case of intimidation has been opened against the businessman at Townhill police station. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese confirmed there was an incident at the security company owner’s home and said the man’s children arrived and opened the house so their mother could escape. He said there was an underlying issue of domestic violence that police are dealing with. A source said it is alleged the woman was locked inside the house on Wednesday afternoon. Two security guards stood by to ensure no one entered or left the house. They were allegedly following orders given to them by the man. When police arrived at the home they were refused entry by the guards. The source said the woman was escorted out of the house by police. Ngobese said the businessman was not on the property when police have arrived. “No arrests have been made yet,” said Ngobese.
