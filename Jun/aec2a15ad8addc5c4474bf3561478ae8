Two uMngeni licensing office officials in Howick should be sacked immediately for helping candidates pass their learner’s licences, the municipality’s disciplinary committee chairperson has said. The committee found Meschack Ndlovu and Nkosinathi Zondi guilty for using laser light pointers to help point out answers on the computer screen for applicants writing the test. They were among a number of staff arrested in March last year after investigations uncovered rampant corruption involving officials issuing fraudulent learner’s licences. Five officials, including two traffic officers, nine learner’s licence applicants, and a cleaner, were arrested on March 7, 2018, during a joint operation by the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s (RTMC) National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the Hawks and the KZN Traffic Department. Three more people, including a driving school owner, were also arrested on suspicion of being involved in the corruption. According to the disciplinary finding, both Zondi and Ndlovu were found guilty of gross dishonesty and/or violation of the National Road Traffic Act and Regulations (Section 17 And Regulation 104). Ndlovu, who was not an examiner, was moreover unlawfully inside the exam venue during the exams. The two still face criminal charges, along with the others implicated in the matter. They are all currently out on bail and are set to appear again at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday.
