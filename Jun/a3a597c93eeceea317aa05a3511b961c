An 85-year-old pensioner was thrown on her bed and gagged with a sock in her home in Hayfields, in yet another attack on the elderly in the area. The woman has lived in the house for more than 25 years with her husband, who is also in his 80s. The Witness arrived in the quiet, leafy neighbourhood on Thursday to find police combing the area. Several family members were also at the house to comfort the woman. One source told The Witness that the woman’s husband was inside the house when the attack happened, but did not hear the intruder because he is partially deaf. “The intruder came into this house on Monday but when he saw [the husband] he left. [Yesterday] the elderly woman came outside to open the gate for someone and when she got back she saw the man. He caught her, threw her on the bed, gagged her and then ran away.” Neighbours were alerted when the woman started screaming, police said. SAPS officers and private security personnel combed the area for most of yesterday morning. They discovered a pair of black trousers and black shoes near the scene, but it was unclear whether these belonged to the intruder. One family member, who did not want to be named or to reveal the names of the pensioners, said the woman had been left traumatised by her ordeal. He added that she did not need medical attention, but the family were still monitoring her condition. “It could have been worse, but nothing like this has happened here before. It just goes to show that things like this don’t happen only at night. This was in broad daylight.” He told The Witness he hoped people in the area would be more aware of incidents like this. In October last year, Jimmy McGlinchey, a Scottish national who moved to South Africa 30 years ago, was strangled in his home in Hayfields. And in May this year, 83-year-old Hayfields man Norman Gayer shot dead an intruder after experiencing several attempted robberies at his home.
