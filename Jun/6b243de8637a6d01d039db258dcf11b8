A man who is believed to be a drug addict went on a shooting rampage around the province, targeting drug dealers who he blamed for ruining his life. The 56-year-old man killed two people and injured two others before he was arrested and taken into police custody on Friday afternoon. The shooter started his rampage in Dundee at around 5.30 pm last Thursday. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the suspect approached a 41-year-old man on Argyle Street and shot him in the face with a shotgun. The victim later died in hospital. The shooter fled the murder scene and drove to Richards Bay, arriving there just before midnight. He killed a 25-year-old man, shooting him multiple times in the street. He again sped off, showing up in Howick on Friday morning at around 6.10 am. Mbele said the man filled his car with petrol at a garage in Howick’s Main Street and raced off without paying. By 7 am on Friday, the shooter had arrived in Estcourt, where, armed with his shotgun, he entered the home of a man in Colita Qonti Street and started an argument. “The shooter pointed his shotgun at the man, who got into a scuffle with the attacker and who managed to grab the shotgun away from him,” said Mbele. The man then sped off to Lady­smith where he stopped for ammunition at a gun shop in Queen Street. While the store employees were showing him the ammunition, he grabbed a box and fled. The shooter’s final stop was back in Dundee, where at about 11.30 am he shot a 29-year-old man multiple times. The victim is recovering in hospital. Detectives finally caught up with the killer on Friday afternoon, arresting him in the centre of Dundee. Mbele said he has been linked to all the incidents and is expected to appear in the Dundee Magistrate’s Court today. It had been rumoured that there were two more killings, in Newcastle and Pietermaritzburg, but Mbele said no reports of these had been received.
