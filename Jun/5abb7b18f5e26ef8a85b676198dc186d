Part of Copesville have been without street lights for the past few days, while other sections have been in the dark for seven months or more. Frustrated community members claim that street lights in Holden Road have been out for seven months, while those in Sarge Road, Porsche Road and Azurite Place have been out for different lengths of time, ranging from several days to a few weeks. Residents living in Aventurine Way said they had street lights in their road until recently and are unsure why the lights were now off. A community member posted in the Copesville Community Crime Watch chat group that he had seen men climbing up light poles in Aventurine Way. The men had a home-made wooden ladder which they used to get to the top of the pole and then began connecting electricity wires illegally at around 8.30 pm on Sunday. The community says they have been reporting that they have no street lights for months and in some cases, have several reference numbers for the same issue. Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Ngcobo said they have a programme in place to reconnect street lights. She added that, while the council has a challenge with its finances, they had been allocated money to employ a service provider to fix lights. Unfortunately there is a backlog and Ngcobo appealed to residents to be patient while they slowly start lighting up Pietermaritzburg’s streets again. “With regards to illegal connections, we will investigate this,” she added. “We encourage residents to report any illegal connections as they are not only a danger to people and animals, but can also cause severe damage to municipal infrastructure.”
