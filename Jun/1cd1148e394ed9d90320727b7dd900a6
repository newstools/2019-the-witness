A bodyguard of Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo, who is facing a murder charge, is allegedly being treated “brutally” by investigators while in custody. This emerged at the Camperdown Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, where Nkosinathi Nqayi (35) was due to have his bail application heard. Nqayi is alleged to have murdered Lungisani Mnguni (34) in Enkanyezeni, near the Lion Park, in November 2017. His bail application had to be postponed to next week, however, after his attorney, Phumlani Fakude, requested extra time to respond to an affidavit by the state to oppose bail. Fakude told the court that he had only received the affidavit yesterday, and needed the adjournment to be able to fully respond to the claims made in it. The state’s affidavit has not yet been put on the record in court. Fakude also requested that investigators bring it to his attention whenever they intend questioning Nqayi, alleging that they had been rough with him during his time in custody. He said Nqayi had to be taken to the Westville prison hospital because a heart condition he has was “triggered” when investigators “booked him out” of his prison cell for investigation purposes. The court ruled that investigators had to inform Fakude whenever they intended questioning Nqayi. Nqayi made his fleeting appearance in front of a full gallery. Two heavily-armed police officers were also in court for his appearance. He has been in custody since being arrested on June 14. He was nabbed while on duty at the mayoral house in Bisley by the task team investigating political killings in the province. He will appear for his bail application next Tuesday.
