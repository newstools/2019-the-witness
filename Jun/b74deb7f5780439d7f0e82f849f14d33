Michaelhouse is undertaking a massive renovation of its campus, with several upgrades and new buildings in the pipeline. Builders are hard at work creating a new quad and boarding houses at the prestigious school. Already, the school has completed a new science block, which was opened last year, and a heritage centre was finished this year. The science block has the capacity to generate its own energy and feed surplus energy into the school’s main grid. Murray Witherspoon, the school’s marketing manager, said old boys have donated significant amounts to “achieve what has been the most significant period of infrastructural development in the school’s 123-year history”.  New extensions to the science block, which was opened last year. He said the new developments include: • An aquatics facility, which includes a long course water polo pool. It was completed in 2016; • A renovated science block; • An archive facility in the new heritage centre and old boys’ clubhouse. The heritage centre has physical archival material as well as a digital repository. This was completed late last year; • An upgrade to Michaelhouse theatre’s audio visual capacity, with a seven-metre cinema screen. This was completed last year; • A second water-based hockey astro turf, to be completed later this year; • Two new boarding houses to better accommodate pupils, dropping the number from 70 pupils per house to 60. This will be completed later this year; and • An upgrade to the gym and wellness centre to start next year. Architect Nick Grice, of Grice Bellars Architects in Pietermaritzburg, designed new buildings in keeping with the traditional “red brick” style, using firelight satin face brick from supplier Coro­brik. “While not exactly the same as the original buildings, it was an excellent match for the original salmon-pink brick,” he said.
