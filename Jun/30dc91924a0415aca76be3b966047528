“The buck stops
here.” This was the warning by KZN Transport, Community Safety and
Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda to criminals who have been holding Imbali under
siege. Kaunda, who was joined by SAPS uMgungundlovu South cluster
management and a heavy police contingent, was speaking at Imbali Unit 1
following a spate of hijackings and murders in the area. He said police had already come up with plans to stop the
heinous crimes. “I can’t divulge some of the plans because it would give the
criminals an upper hand,” he told residents. “But some plans include police patrols. I want you to go
back home and warn the criminals because the police are going to be fighting
fire with fire.” This month, The Witness reported that three people were
hijacked in Imbali in one weekend. In one incident, a police officer was
wounded when she was shot in the leg during a botched hijacking. On social media, VW Polo drivers from Imbali had also been
warned to avoid driving at night, especially around the township. Kaunda said 32 murders had occurred in the Plessislaer
policing precinct, which Imbali falls under, in 2018, while in the last three
months 36 people had already been killed. “This is nonsense. It doesn’t make
any sense. I’m giving police until the first week of August to conduct and
survey this area and when we come back here, I want all the names of the people
they have arrested. We are not going to take this lying down,” he said. He also said he will act against police officers who collude
with criminals, terrorising communities. “The first intervention to be made
will be to arrests the criminals, that should happen in the shortest possible
time. “We are also going to be very hard on any police officer
that colludes with criminals.” Meanwhile, residents who attended the meeting said although
they were determined to fight crime in the area, it was difficult without
enough police assistance. “The satellite police station in Imbali has been
rendered useless. It’s just an information desk where you go to fill in
affidavits. You can’t report crime there as there are only two officers on
duty,” said one resident. Another resident, Wendy Duma, criticised police officers at
the Plessislaer police station for “dragging their feet” in solving cases. “When you report at the Plessislaer police station, nothing
happens. They are too comfortable and maybe management should consider a shake
up at that police station. The police officers at the charge office are very
rude.” Sindi Ngidi reiterated Duma’s sentiments, adding that since
her brother’s murder last September, they had not received a single update from
the police on investigations. Kaunda assured the residents that while the police had
limited resources, they will strain every nerve to ensure that the residents
are safe. Meanwhile, on Friday morning Kaunda also visited Weenen,
outside Estcourt, where two women and a child were attacked last week while
they were sleeping. Police believe that the murder toll in Weenen, which is
currently at 39, emanates from a long-running faction fight between alleged
criminals from Nhlawe and KwaMadondo. This was the warning by KZN Transport, Community Safety and
