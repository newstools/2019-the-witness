Four people, including two teenagers, have appeared in court in connection with the murder last year of three members of a traditional indlamu dance group called Abadlovozi. Nduduzo Dlomo (19), Sandile Ngwane (25), Khelulula Ngcobo (25) and Bongani Makaye (19) appeared on Friday in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court. The prosecutor, Rene Padayachee, asked that they be remanded in custody to July 26, for the outcome of an identification parade. They are alleged to have murdered twins Asanda and Sandile Mbatha (15), and their friend, Siyabonga Hlomuka (16), in September 2018. They were shot dead in a one-room mud structure on a steep slope in the Madiba area, just outside Sobantu. The accused are also charged with the attempted murders of Sifiso Masondo (16), Khalake Mthuli (15) and Lindalani Dlamini (16). The Witness reported that the six teenagers, including a girl believed to be 12 or 13, were in the structure when two gunmen barged in and shot everyone. The twins attended events to perform indlamu (traditional dance). People interviewed at the time said they suspected the murders to have been sparked by a dispute between the Abadlovozi group and another indlamu group from Tamboville. The Sobantu and Tamboville indlamu groups were formed under the Sobantu Secondary School’s banner of cultural activities and the members of both groups were pupils at the school. However, the motive has not yet been revealed in court.
