One person was confirmed dead after a municipal car with five occupants hit a pedestrian and rolled near Henley Dam at the weekend. Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide against the Msunduzi employee who was driving the car, which was part of the City’s head office car pool. The driver is said to be an employee in the municipality’s fleet division. It is not clear where the car was going when the accident happened. A municipal source said the vehicle was written off, adding that the accident may have occurred as a result of ongoing misuse of municipal vehicles by some officials, some of whom use them to run personal errands. According to Midlands EMS paramedics who attended the scene, they found the vehicle off the road with extensive structural damage. A statement from Midlands EMS said that five occupants had been flung from the car and were found outside the wreckage. It said that one person was declared dead at the scene while four others suffered minor to moderate injuries. Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha told The Witness the cause of the crash was not known as the driver was still in hospital. In April, acting municipal manager Neli Ngcobo said an internal audit report cited a number of problems with the management of the City’s fleet. These include a high vacancy rate, daily trip authority and logbooks not completed before trips, vehicles not having services at least annually, competency pre-testing not performed on drivers, and accidents not reported timeously. Last September The Witness reported that Msunduzi risked suffering financial losses due to inadequate tracking systems and costs incurred for maintaining vehicles used by incompetent drivers. Ngcobo said some of the cars, although they are new, were breaking down and no one monitors the fleet. In April, a video clip of a municipal car being driven on the wrong side of the road was circulated on social media.
