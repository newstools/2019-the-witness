A suspect in the murder of 13-year-old Snegugu Mthembu made a subdued appearance in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, following confusion that he had been released by police after his arrest on Tuesday. Nkosinathi Gwamanda (45), who lives in the Jika Joe informal settlement, alleges he was arrested by mistake. Gwamanda’s attorney said he claims that police arrested him because he has the same surname as the suspect they were looking for. Wearing a white anorak jacket, Gwamanda appeared worried, and when his case was adjourned to Monday, he mumbled something to the person sitting next to him in the dock, and shook his head. He plopped down on the bench, stretched out his fingers across his face and slouched. His court appearance was low-key, considering the violent protest action that had taken place since the girl’s disappearance on Sunday. Police said on Thursday they had provided incorrect information to the media about the suspect’s release. The murdered girl, known as “Sne”, was a pupil at the Open Gate Special School. She had been playing outside with her friends when she disappeared. The girl’s half-naked body was discovered on Tuesday morning by her mother, Phumeza Dlamini, trapped among the reeds on the bank of the Dorpspruit River near the informal settlement.
