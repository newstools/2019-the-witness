Disturbing video footage of a teenager being beaten and stabbed to death at a Mpumalanga high school during lunch break led to the arrest of four men early on Monday. Magma Security and Investigations, the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit and the Provincial Organised Crime Unit were tipped off that four men believed to be part of the murder were hiding in a house in Georgedale. After the tip-off on Sunday night, by early Monday morning police and Magma stormed the house, taking the men by “complete surprise” and arresting them. Magma Security’s Shaheen Suleiman said there are still more arrests to be made. Video footage of the attack, apparently at Thandaza High School, went viral on social media after the 18-year-old’s death last Wednesday. The footage shows a young man crouching on the ground in a school yard near some prefabs. Out of nowhere, a group of men dressed in casual clothes swarm in and surround the boy, some kicking him while others take turns at stabbing him. The person filming can be heard screaming for the men to stop, while another pupil waves her hands frantically at the men in the hopes of getting them to stop the attack. The murder took place in broad daylight. The footage appears to have been taken during lunch break as many pupils in uniform can be seen standing around on the grass behind the prefabs. Toward the end of the frenzied attack, a man can be seen kicking the pupil in the head. Another man then stabs him in the stomach before walking off with the group. Screams can be heard from many pupils who stood helpless against the group of men armed with knives. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the pupil had multiple stab wounds. She said the men, aged between 19 and 23, will be profiled to check if they are linked to any other cases committed in Mpumalanga. “They are expected to appear in court soon,” said Gwala.
