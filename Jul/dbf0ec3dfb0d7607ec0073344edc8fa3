A security guard was stripped naked while being held at knifepoint and then locked in a toilet during a robbery at a Willowton business on Monday evening. Three men made off with Thembekile Transport’s safe, which contained cash and bus keys. They also took CCTV monitors. Phaphamani Zondi, a manager at the company, said the men drove into their premises at about 5 pm on Monday evening, just a few minutes before the guard arrived at work to begin his shift. “When he got here, they tied him up at knifepoint with cable ties. They gagged him and locked him in the toilet.” Zondi said the robbers tried to open the safe but were unable to. They then used a blanket to drag the safe off the premises and into their car. They took two monitors from a table before leaving. The security guard waited until the robbers left, before getting out of the toilet and then called for help, Zondi said. He said the security guard would get a few days off. “He’s shaken up, but he’s okay.” The Witness was unable to contact the security guard on Tuesday. “We will have to beef up security. This is the first time anything like this has happened at our premises, and we’ve been here for 13 years,” said Zondi. Communications officer at Mountain Rise police station Warrant Officer Joshua Maistry said the men made off with about R100 000 in cash. “Police on the scene got information of a Toyota Tazz, with registration number NP 18924, seen in the vicinity of the scene.” He encouraged anyone with information to contact Colonel Sibongiseni Phoswa on 079 500 0264.
