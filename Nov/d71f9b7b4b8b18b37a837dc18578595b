Promising Pietermaritzburg sprinter Jessica Bompas
(pictured) is one of just two athletes from KwaZulu-Natal who stand a chance to
represent South Africa at next year’s IAAF U20 World Championships in Kenya. Athletics South Africa have announced a preparation squad of
34 athletes for the event and 18-year-old Bompas is part of it. Durbanite Amy Naude is the other KZN representative in the
squad that is dominated by Athletics Gauteng North. The IAAF U20 World Championships event is scheduled to take
place in July. Bompas, who is a matriculant at St Anne’s Diocesan College,
has been selected for the 4x100 m relay event, while Naude stands a chance in
the 4x400 m relay team. The news of Bompas making the preparation squad was welcomed
with great excitement by her team, Elite Performance Group. Her coach Chris White said this was a great achievement for
the youngster as it’s in line with what they have been working towards. “She is
excited to be included, we talked about it the other day and she is really
putting in some hard work now to make sure she is included in the final team,”
said White. “She has worked tirelessly since primary school to achieve
this honour and with KZN not really having focused athletics, it’s really a big
achievement for her. She has been a South African and KZN champion in 200m and
100m. She ran multiple times since the age of 11 and has been on the podium on
almost every year.” Bompas’ season best is 12,06 seconds in the 100 m while in
the 200 m it’s 24,40 sec. In 2017, she ran the 200 m race in Durban with the
time of 24,02 which is her personal best in the event. According to her coach, the teenager has set herself high
target that includes taking the international stage by storm starting with the
World Champs next year. “Jess has a plan to make the 2024 Olympics, so our next step
is to make the junior team for next year’s World Champs and the Commonwealth
Games for 2022 and from there the Olympic Games,” he said.
