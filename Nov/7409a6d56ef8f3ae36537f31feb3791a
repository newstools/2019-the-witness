The trial of a 47-year-old foreign national who is alleged to have conspired to kidnap a businessman’s daughter for ransom, has been set down for next year. Asif Mohammed, who is out on R5 000 bail, appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg regional court on Thursday. It is alleged that he wanted to kidnap the teenager and demand ransom of between R3 million to R4 million. The plan was to take her outside the province. It is further alleged that he also had a list of who his next two victims would be. During Mohammed’s opposed bail application, Warrant Officer Johannes de Lange told the court that Mohammed had contacted a police informer in August to say that he had moved to Pietermaritzburg where there is a “lucrative business in kidnapping”. He told the informer that he had identified a wealthy family and they could make between R3 million to R4 million by kidnapping the daughter. Mohammed asked the informant to organise people who would kidnap the teenager and take her outside KZN, preferably to Lesotho, and he would negotiate ransom. De Lange also said that Mohammed kept phoning the informant to find out when he was getting people to assist with the kidnapping. The informant decided on a date and Mohammad said he would prepare everything for the kidnapping. An undercover investigation was subsequently launched. Two undercover policemen posed as the kidnappers and began interacting with Mohammad. On September 21, he gave the policemen the residential address of the teenager he wanted kidnapped. He also said that he knew two other people he wanted kidnapped. Six days later they met again. This time Mohammad confirmed the target. He handed the agents a SIM card and told them it was to be used after the kidnapping because it could not be traced by police. Mohammad was arrested the same day for conspiracy to commit kidnapping.
