A Northdale family are searching for their pitbull puppy after it was snatched from inside their yard. Buddah, a two-month-old dog with a white and black coat, was pulled through a gap in the front gate of the family’s Champa Place home while no one was home last Friday morning. CCTV footage taken by a neighbouring home showed the dog being called to the gate by some men and then he was pulled through the gate while the family’s Jack Russell barked at the men. The footage has been shared on social media by many concerned people. A post accompanying the video says the men were seen heading toward ground near Georgia Road, which is near Heather Secondary School. This is the second time in about six months that a pitbull puppy has been taken from the family’s house, despite them having made upgrades to secure the property since the first incident. Samantha Naidoo, Buddah’s owner, said her dogs were left in their front yard last Friday. When she saw the dog was missing, she asked a neighbour who has CCTV cameras to see the day’s footage. Naidoo said the dog was seen to follow the men. She said the family have since been searching in surrounding neighbourhoods for the puppy. “It’s very sad. We had an appointment with the vet for this weekend to microchip the dog and give him his last injection,” a dejected Naidoo said. The Pietermaritzburg Animal Rescue and Rehome (Parr) warned thieves were targeting pitbulls, especially in the Copesville area. The dogs are abused in dog fights and the puppies are sold, Parr’s Chavonne Chetty said.
