Disaster management teams in the province are on high alert as severe thunderstorms are expected on Monday and Tuesday. Weather forecaster Wiseman Dlamini said on Sundday that there is an 80% probability of thunderstorms today and 60% tomorrow in Pietermaritzburg. Severe storms are expected throughout the province, he said. The MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sipho Hlomuka, said that the thunderstorms could lead to localised flooding and he has placed disaster management teams on high alert. The warning comes after four people died in a lightning strike in Mkhuze in northern KZN recently. Hlomuka urged residents across the province to be cautious as bad weather still poses a serious danger to communities. “Our disaster management teams are on standby in areas that are prone to flooding and they will be monitoring the situation. We have full confidence in our teams’ ability to provide the necessary support should the need arise,” he said. The department also urged residents to be cautious, especially motorists and pedestrians. “Our province has lost many lives to lightning strikes and flooding and we are calling on pedestrians to ensure that they do not cross walkways or bridges that are prone to flooding. Those with livestock are urged to first seek shelter at the slightest indication of lightning,” said Hlomuka.
