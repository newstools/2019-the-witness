A Montrose animal lover made the grim discovery of a hadeda ibis that had been shot dead with an arrow last Friday. Sam Berriman found the bird lying on Montrose Drive in the dark while the area was experiencing load shedding. “We were returning from a braai and I saw something black lying on the road. I thought it was my cat, which always runs around the area.” She snapped a photo of the hadeda and circulated it on social media. “People were horrified. What if it hit a person, or someone’s pet?”’ Berriman does not believe the hadeda was shot by accident, and said the shooter was likely to have been about 15 metres away from the bird. “I brought it home and someone advised me to call the SPCA. We were going to take it there on Saturday, but noticed that our gardener had pulled out the arrow from the bird without us knowing. “The SPCA said they would be unable to open a case if the arrow was removed,” she said. Berriman yesterday took the bird to a vet to be cremated. “It kills me because I love animals. During school holidays kids get up to trouble and their parents don’t know, so maybe it was that. You shoot an arrow like that into the air it will hit something.” The SPCA’s Alec Wylie advised people who find themselves in this situation to immediately call the SPCA. “Or they can put the animal into a black plastic bag and bring it to is. We will do an autopsy. If they suspect who the culprit is they can tell us and we will approach the person and get them charged.” Jeanne Thompson, the KZN Archery chairperson, believed the arrow in question was likely used for hunting because of its sharp tip. She said bows that use such arrows can cost about R2 000, and arrows can cost at least R80 each. “People need to understand that this is not a toy. You have to be trained to use it and even when hunting, people are taught how to kill humanely.”
