At least 18 Hollywoodbets employees were admitted to hospital after inhaling toxic fumes emitted by a generator at the outlet on Church Street on Sunday afternoon. A source told The Witness that he witnessed people being dragged out of the betting outlet after 1 pm on Sunday. One of the people was a pregnant woman. The source said the outlet has had no electricity since Friday and they have been using a generator that was allegedly emitting toxic fumes. He said he was also told that the ventilation at the store was poor, making the situation worse. It is unclear if the generator caught fire on Sunday or if the employees and the patrons were affected by fumes. Kavith Harrilall, spokesperson for Midlands Hospital, said yesterday afternoon 18 people — 14 women and four men, all of whom are employees at a local betting business — were being treated for “smoke inhalation” at the hospital. He added that just on Saturday, employees at the hospital had a mock emergency drill, which helped hone the skills they needed to handle Sunday’s situation. The Hollywoodbets manager, who refused to be named, said there had been no fire at their outlet and then refused to confirm if her employees were admitted to hospital.
