A newborn baby was abducted on Friday in a clothing shop in the CBD. The mother was at East Boom Clinic with her newborn baby girl for a check-up when she was approached by a woman dressed in a maroon dress. The woman asked the mother to come with her to her department as they were looking for a mother with a newborn to whom they could offer some gifts to, such as baby clothes. The mother was tempted, and she agreed. On their way, the woman saw a dress in a shop window which she said she wanted to buy for her niece. She asked the mother to go in with her, she then asked the mother to stand in the queue and pay for the dress, while the con woman stood aside with the baby. A few minutes later, the mother turned around and the woman had disappeared with the baby. The incident was reported to the store manager, who immediately called the police.
