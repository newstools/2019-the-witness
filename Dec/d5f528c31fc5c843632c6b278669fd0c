Msunduzi garbage collectors have been asking for Christmas presents before removing garbage. Athlone resident Aletta Wegener complained that workers banged on her gate shouting “Christmas, Christmas” on Tuesday, which is the area’s garbage collection day. “I didn’t go outside and just left them. When I went outside later, I noticed our bags weren’t collected.” Wegener said her domestic worker had heard from the garbage collectors that they would only be removing rubbish if they were given Christmas gifts. Stacks of bin bags still lined Athlone streets yesterday. Wegener said: “They probably wanted things like money or cake or biscuits. They can’t expect bonuses from the public when there’s so much striking [by workers] and service delivery is so bad.” DA caucus leader in Msunduzi, Sibongiseni Majola, said this behaviour constituted criminality, and said offending staff members should be charged. “The workers get a 13th cheque for the festive period. Residents pay the municipality and should get quality services.” Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the matter will be investigated and that this conduct was not acceptable. She said offenders would be dealt with. She appealed to the public to report incidents like this.
