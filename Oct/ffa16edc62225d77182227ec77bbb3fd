A boxed set of 10 18-carat gold stamps, weighing a total of 157 g, was sold at Cannon & Cannon Auctioneers in Hilton on Tuesday to a bidder from Cape Town, for R85 000. The South African stamp heritage collection, which was struck and issued by the Africana Commemorative Mint, was one of a limited edition of 500 sets made. These unique stamps were reportedly made to commemorate South Africa’s postal history, dating back as far as the various iterations of the classic Cape Triangular from 1853. Before the sale, the South African stamp heritage collection had been given a reserve price of between R65 000 and R85 000. Also on auction was the tiny “Prostitute’s Pistol”, featured in Tuesday’s edition of The Witness, which went under the hammer for R2 300. Measuring just 17 cm in length, the weapon was used by women in the 19th Century to protect themselves. It earned the nickname the “Prostitute’s Pistol” because it was made and used at around the time when serial killer Jack the Ripper was terrorising London’s Whitechapel area. When fired, the Ladies’ Pistol sounded like a real gun, giving its owner time to run for her life if she found herself in a dangerous situation. Most of these pistols were made from metal and then silver plated to give them a silver patina. They were also small enough to fit into a handbag. Other items on sale included a selection of military items once owned by Colonel George Hereward Cardew CBE DSO, who served in the Anglo-Boer War and World War 1.
