A pitbull was euthanased after being hit by a car and about 15 stray dogs were rescued during a busy night for the Pie-termaritzburg SPCA on Sunday night. The SPCA reported receiving many calls to attend to distressed animals during loud firework displays for Diwali celebrations. The SPCA’s general manager, Alec Wylie, said members of the public brought in nine stray dogs on Sunday night. He said two dogs had been brought in after being knocked over in separate incidents, one of which, a pitbull, had to be put down. That dog sustained broken hind legs and a broken pelvis. “We were absolutely busy. Dogs get disturbed by the noise and they run on the road because they’re trying to run away from the noise. “It’s very stressful for them.” He said, however, that this Diwali was better than previous years and fewer animals were found to be in distress. The branch spent most of the day dealing with pet owners claiming missing dogs. Wylie said: “People who burst fireworks must be more responsible and be considerate if their neighbours have animals. And pet-owners must ensure pets are kept indoors and safe.” The Kloof and Highway SPCA also reported a busy weekend, where one dog and one cat were killed in car accidents. The branch said 24 dogs, five cats, a tortoise, a hadeda and a dassie were admitted as stray animals during the weekend. The uMngeni SPCA, however, reported no incidents. The branch’s Dudu Abraham said the area has a relatively small community that celebrates Diwali with fireworks, adding that the SPCA did a lot of drives to educate the public about animal safety.
