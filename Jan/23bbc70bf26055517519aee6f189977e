After months of having to face crater-like potholes with no resolution in sight, a fed-up Clarendon community, in collaboration with SealCoat, took to the streets to fix the potholes themselves. After working from 7 am until 2 pm in the scorching sun on Sunday, the residents are “very happy” that the roads are smooth once again. Rowan White, of the Clarendon Community Association, said the decision to fix the potholes came after it became “abundantly evident that the municipality is either incapable or not interested in attending to our deteriorating roads and requests to repair our potholes”. “We decided to stop complaining and opted to fix the problem ourselves,” said White. He said requests for donations were made through their community Whats­App group. “The response from the community was incredible,” said White. He said a man who works for SealCoat and who is a member of the community undertook to fix the potholes with a team of three other people. “It feels like it was through sheer luck that he volunteered,” said White. Clarendon resident Pam Reach said the four men had fixed all the potholes in Fettes and Kitchener roads yesterday. “All the community members were very supportive and were out and around to hand out cold drinks and food,” said Reach. “We also just wanted to show our support and gratitude. Everyone is very happy. We are quite a motivated community. “If we had not taken the initiative, I do not think the potholes would have been fixed for a long time.”
