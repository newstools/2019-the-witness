Former president Jacob Zuma’s fiancée Nonkanyiso Conco will be instituting legal action against those behind the fake Twitter account registered under her name. In an interview with Zulu news­paper Ilanga, Conco said she has already requested Twitter management to identify the individual behind the fake account. “They are busy investigating as we speak and once the person has been identified we will then institute legal steps,” she said. This after a Twitter account under the name @MrsConcoZuma had caught the attention of social media users last week. Tweets sent from the account include Conco purportedly declaring her undying love for Zuma, welcoming the formation of the new political party linked to former GCIS head Mzwanele Manyi and berating the former president’s critics. The tweets caught the eye of some ANC senior leaders, including National Executive Committee (NEC) member Derek Hanekom, who wanted to know which political party Conco belonged to. Conco, who has an active Instagram account, said she does not have a Twitter account. “I have never had a Twitter account in my life,” she said. A radio presenter at regional radio station Vuma FM, Conco said the tweets did not reflect her personality and that any person who knew her would have realised the account was fake. “What worries me is that even some high profile people were duped into believing that it was me sending those tweets,” she said. Apart from the fact that she was not the kind of a person who freely shared information about her personal life, Conco said sending out the kind of information that was sent from the fake account would have compromised her professional integrity and tainted the Vuma FM brand. A former pupil of Haythorne High School in Woodlands, Pietermaritzburg, Conco has a nine-month-old baby boy with Zuma. Twitter has since suspended the fake account, saying it violated its rules.
