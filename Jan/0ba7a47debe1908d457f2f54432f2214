Two Howick High School pupils, Jané Buys and David Hyslop, each obtained seven distinctions in the National Senior Certificate exams. Buys said she was expecting good results after working “consistently hard” throughout her matric year. She added that she plans on following her childhood passion of studying dentistry, but has yet to decide if she will be attending the University of the Witwatersrand or the University of Pretoria. Hyslop, Howick High’s former head boy and top academic pupil last year, said it was “awesome” to know that his hard work had paid off. The final exam period had been very stressful for him, he added, saying that on the morning he was due to write one of his exams he had only slept for two hours. Hyslop will be studying mechatronics engineering (robotics) this year
