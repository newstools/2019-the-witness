The body of 16-year-old Mthobisi Mnguni, who drowned while swimming with friends at a Camperdown farm dam on Friday afternoon, was recovered on Monday. A source, who asked not to be named, told The Witness that Mthobisi, who is from Hopewell but had been visiting friends in the area, was swimming with two other teenage boys at around 3 pm on Friday when he drowned. “The two other boys said Mthobisi had said he wouldn’t swim because he had [sinusitis].” He said once they had already swum across the dam they saw Mthobisi going into the water and start struggling. “They swam back to him but struggled to keep his head above water and he drowned and disappeared under the water.” The man said the boys went to call for help and the incident was reported to the police. “Two members from the Pietermaritzburg Search and Rescue Unit came out to look for him and left at 8 pm as it had become too dark to continue searching. “A bigger group came back on Saturday and Sunday but still could not find the boy. “Concerned family, community and church members gathered at the bank of the dam to pray that the boy’s body be recovered. “They even threw a living goat into the dam with the belief that the body of the boy would float to the surface but nothing happened,” he said. The teen’s body was recovered by the Search and Rescue Unit on Monday around noon. When The Witness arrived at the scene on Monday after the body had been found, the grieving family were gathered under a nearby tree. They declined to speak to the media. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, confirmed the teen’s identity and said a formal inquest will be conducted.
