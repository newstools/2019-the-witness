Popular Midlands restaurant Piggly Wiggly has apologised for obstructing paramedics responding to a call about a pensioner, Jerry Naicker, who collapsed last week. The owners of the eatery, Rudi and Cindy Kassier, came under fire following reports that the latter objected to the presence of the paramedics’ vehicle on the front lawn. The medics were allegedly ordered to move the vehicle before they could attend to Naicker (82). The Kassiers posted their apology on Facebook on Tuesday but it was rejected by most social media users who deemed it to be insincere. The statement read: “We recognise that her actions caused distress to Mr Naicker and his family and we unreservedly apologise to him and to them. She [Cindy] further recognises that she should have handled the entire situation differently.” The couple have also had a private meeting with the Naickers, who they said had accepted their apology. Naicker’s daughter, Loshini Lawrence, however, said that during Sunday’s meeting the Kassiers did not display sincerity or compassion. “We made it clear to them that what we experienced should never happen to anyone. It was wrong in so many ways. “The sad part is that there was no constructive steps from their side to demonstrate that they meant their apology,” she added. Lawrence said she had hoped the Kassiers would have taken tangible steps to show the public that what happened was not intentional, but that did not happen. “I think the only reason they apologised was because of the backlash on social media because people were threatening to boycott their restaurant.” Lawrence said the family were grateful that Naicker was recuperating following his release from hospital. She added that they were trying to keep his blood pressure down as he was due to return to hospital for further tests next week.
