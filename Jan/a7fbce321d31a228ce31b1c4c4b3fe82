Yet another unfinished work site by Msunduzi workers has raised the ire of residents — this time outside a house in Dunveria Heights, Northdale. Msunduzi dug up the road in front of the driveway in December 2017 to perform major work on a burst water pipe that services the entire road, but the site is yet to be properly re-tarred. The part of the driveway in question is just outside the main front gate and is on a slight incline. The owner of the property, Balan Padayachee, said driving out of the property was like “driving into a ditch” because of the uneven surface left after the pipe job. “What’s more is that we have to drive in at an angle to avoid the ditch when we enter the property,” he told The Witness. “When it rains, the soil left exposed gets muddy and tyres slip when driving over it. The uneven concrete also damages cars — one tenant had his bumper come off when he drove over it.” Three families live on the large property. Their cars are being damaged because of the uneven driveway surface. “I have tried to even out the surface using stones, but it gets washed away in the rain,” Padayachee said. “I have complained to the municipality so many times and no one there is able to tell me why it is still like this.” Padayachee also claimed that he had to clear debris left by Msunduzi workers after they performed their work on the pipe. “It’s a ridiculous situation, and now it may cost me thousands to fix something the municipality is responsible for.” Msunduzi did not respond to a query. The Witness has reported on several similar incidents in the past year. Last year, Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo intervened when workers dug a trench to perform pipe repairs and left without finishing the site outside a business on West Street. In another report, a large hole was formed on the pavement at Langalibalele (Longmarket) Street after municipal workers had dug up a pipe and not sealed the site.
