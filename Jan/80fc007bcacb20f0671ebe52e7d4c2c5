The guardian of a 13-year-old Grade 8 boy is fuming after her nephew was allegedly slapped by a Dunveria Secondary School teacher on Tuesday. The woman, who asked not to be named to protect the identity of her nephew, said the boy was slapped inside the classroom by a teacher. “My nephew told us that the teacher had instructed them to rearrange the desks. While the boys were moving the desks around the teacher came up to my nephew and asked where his exercise book was and then slapped him. His classmates can attest to this,” said the woman. She said the family was contacted by the school on Tuesday during school hours telling them to fetch the child as he was bleeding. “He was bleeding from his nose after the teacher slapped him. The school made him take off his bloodied shirt and gave him a new shirt to wear so that we didn’t see how much he was bleeding.” She said when they got to the school to fetch the boy, the principal and the teacher who had allegedly slapped the child, had left the school. The woman said they took the teen to the clinic, as they don’t have medical aid, and they were told that the boy needed to be taken to x-ray to see what caused the bleeding. “The principal was supposed to take him to the doctor, but he decided to run away with that teacher who slapped my nephew. “He has been bleeding all night and this morning his sheets were covered in blood. He didn’t go to school, but we have not gotten even a single call from the school enquiring about his condition,” said the irate woman. Vusi Ngcobo, from the school’s SGB, said a meeting was to be held on Wednesday night where the matter would be discussed, and they would only give comment on the matter on Thursday. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of common assault was opened at the Pietermaritzburg police station after the Dunveria Secondary School pupil was allegedly assaulted at school. Zwane said no arrests have been made as yet.
