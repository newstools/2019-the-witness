Slain bodyguard Jabulani Mngoma had become like a member of Msunduzi Speaker Jabu Ngubo’s family, having protected her for five years. On Thursday a distraught Ngubo said Mngoma’s death still felt surreal. The Smero resident was shot by an unknown man while celebrating the New Year with his family on Tuesday. “I’ve lost someone who was honest and never lied to me. I’ve lost someone who I know would have risked his life and taken a bullet for me if I came under attack,” Ngubo said yesterday. She added that her entire family knew Mngoma and had grown to love him as he spent half a decade around them. “He didn’t treat me like his principal and was like part of my family. My sister, my aunt and everyone still can’t believe what happened,” Ngubo said. Part of the reason they struggled with the news of his death was that Mngoma’s late brother, Bruce — who was also her bodyguard — was also violently killed just over a year ago. Bruce died in a hail of bullets in KwaCaluza in November 2017. On her conversations with Mngoma’s mother, Thoko Mngoma, Ngubo said both women did not want to know who had killed him as it was not going to bring him back or heal the pain already inflicted. “We don’t even care if the people who did this are arrested. We are saying God knows everything and we are leaving this in His hands. “If the assailants are to pay the price for his death then God must decide what and how it should happen,” said Ngubo. Both women were trying to find comfort in Exodus chapter 14, verse 14, which says: “The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still”. On what she would miss the most about Mngoma, Ngubo said her late protector was a joker amongst her bodyguards and entertained everyone with his antics. “He was a straight talker and I appreciated having someone who always told the truth,” she added. “He also went beyond the call of duty and always prioritised my safety ...” Mngoma’s memorial service will be held at KwaCaluza Hall on Friday at 3 pm.
