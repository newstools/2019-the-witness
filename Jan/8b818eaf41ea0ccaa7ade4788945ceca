Five police officers who hopped out of their vans to take a leak across from Scottsville Primary School have incensed a local mother. Scottsville resident Zeenath Ahmed said she was dropping her children at school when she was affronted by the sight of the five policemen standing in a row, their backs facing their police vehicles, urinating against a hedge “diagonally across from the school”. She said there were two police vans and one police Caddy bakkie parked behind the officers with the doors of the vehicles “wide open”. She said the men were in civilian clothing, and she saw there were other people sitting in the cars also wearing plain clothes. “It is so disgusting. I was just so shocked to see five policemen all urinating in a row in peak morning traffic,” she said. “I was honestly so stunned. It was not just one person but five.” Ahmed said it was unacceptable and she would be laying a complaint at the Alexandra Road police station. “It is unacceptable, and what sort of example does this set for our children when they see police doing such things?” Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said yesterday that urinating in public is against the police code of conduct. “We appeal to the concerned resident to come forward and lay a formal complaint at her nearest police station,” said Zwane. “The police officers’ conduct will be investigated and disciplinary steps will be taken against those involved,” he said.
