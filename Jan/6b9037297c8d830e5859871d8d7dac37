The fire at the New England Road dump site is expected to be fully extinguished today, providing the fire department has the resources and staff to do so. The dump fire started on Sunday afternoon and the Msunduzi fire department has been working around the clock to put the fire out. Msunduzi Fire station commander Nathi Mchunu said the department was slowly making progress in killing the fire, but had few resources and staff to work with. “We have been really busy. We do not know the cause. It is difficult to say, it could have been the heat, it could have been material dumped at the site. “If the weather is still cooler tomorrow [Wednesday] then we should have the fire out by the end of the day,” he said.
