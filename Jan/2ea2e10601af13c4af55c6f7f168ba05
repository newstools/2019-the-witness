Two pupils hit the academic heights at Raisethorpe Secondary. Abhishek Budram and Yusuf Essa both scored seven As in 2018. “It’s really amazing, I didn’t expect it and I’m so happy,” said Abhishek, who studied for six to eight hours a day. He has applied to several universities to study medicine, and is also looking at studying civil engineering as a possibility. Yusuf, who described the unexpected news of his top results as a relief, wants to study mechanical engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.
