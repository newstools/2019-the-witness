KZN MEC for Economic Development Sihle Zikalala, who handed
over electrical goods to Mkhambathini residents during his visit to the area on
Tuesday, shrugged off accusations that government was using state resources to
campaign for the ANC. “The fact that there is an election coming does not mean
that government programmes should stop — I’m here today [on Tuesday] on
government business. When it’s time for me to campaign for the ANC then I will
put on ANC regalia,” he said. Zikalala, who handed over stoves, refrigerators and other
electrical goods to local tuck shop owners and other small business people,
said the recipients were identified during the department’s previous visit to
the area. The recipients, Zikalala said, were small businesspeople who
were struggling to grow their businesses because of a lack of resources. “Some of them have car wash businesses while others are in
the food business — as government we have a duty to support such people,” said
Zikalala, who handed over the items during the department’s retailer support
programme roadshow at the Nembula Sportsground in Mkhambathini. Zikalala handed over the items, which were bought by his
department in conjunction with the national Small Businesses Department, at a
time when electioneering is intensifying ahead of the May 8 general elections. Both the DA and IFP recently accused the ANC of using state
resources to canvass for votes. While Zikalala told Mkhambathini residents that he would not
use government programmes to campaign for the ANC, the MEC said it was only an
ANC-led government that could improve their lives. “In the apartheid period black pensioners used to be paid
their grants once in three or four months. But when the ANC-led government took
over all that changed — the elderly now get paid every month.” Zikalala, who is widely expected to become premier after the
May general elections, is also the ANC chairperson in the province.
