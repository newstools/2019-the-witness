The City’s attempt to suspend one of its striking workers got lost because its notice was sent to the wrong address. Similar letters were delivered by armed guards to some of the striking workers during the weekend. They were asked to sign after receiving the documents but none of the workers took them. The owner of the property where the mis-directed letter was sent brought the confidential notice meant for a cashier to The Witness offices on Tuesday. “I have no idea who this person is or how to get hold of her but I think it’s important that this letter gets to her before she’s officially suspended.” According to the document addressed to the recipient, the City is investigating allegations of gross misconduct against her for engaging in an “unprocedural strike that does not comply with the requirements prescribed in the Labour Relations Act”. Upon receipt, she had 48 hours to make written representation as to why she should not be suspended. Contacted for comment, the cashier — whose identity is known to The Witness — was shocked. She said she was not aware of the notice. “I don’t live at the address on the envelope but I will follow up with the municipality with regards to the letter now that I’m aware of it’s existence.” Attempts to get comment from Msunduzi were unsuccessful.
