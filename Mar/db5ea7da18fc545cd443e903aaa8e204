The City has threatened disciplinary action against two Msunduzi street cleaners who were caught on video throwing rubbish into a private property on Tuesday morning. Video footage of the two cleaners sweeping rubbish into storm water drains and throwing trash over the gate of a private property surfaced on Tuesday morning on a Pietermaritzburg WhatsApp community group. The video shows the pair, who are equipped with gloves, black plastic bags, hats and brooms, picking up one or two pieces of plastic and throwing it over the gate of a private property. People can be seen walking past the cleaners, watching as they pick up more rubbish and throw it over the gate. While one of the cleaners then concentrates on throwing a large pile of rubbish from the street over the gate, the other cleaner can be seen sweeping rubbish into what appears to be a storm water drain. The incident occurred on Temple Street in the CBD. A worker at one of the nearby shops who asked not to be named said the property the pair were dumping rubbish into had been used as shelter for vagrants, but that the Department of Public Works moved the vagrants out on Monday morning. Locals who saw the video were outraged, calling for action to be taken against the two workers.  A man who asked not to be named said he had also personally seen staff sweeping rubbish into a storm water drain. “It’s usually people walking on the roads every day who dispose of their dirt into the storm water drainage system. Nowadays the municipal civil servants do the dumping for them,” he said, asking: “Where are our countrymen heading to?” Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said on Tuesday that they were unaware of such behaviour, but do not condone it. “The matter will be investigated and disciplinary action will be taken against the perpetrators. “We remain committed to keeping our city clean and any efforts to defeat that will not be tolerated,” she said.
