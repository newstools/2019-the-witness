A Northdale Hospital nurse was killed when his car collided with a truck on the R603 in Camperdown on Tuesday afternoon. Professional nurse Zamani Innocent Dlamini (29), who was from Umlazi in Durban but worked at Northdale Hospital, was travelling toward Eston when the incident occurred. Midlands EMS spokesperson Derrick Banks said Dlamini’s car had veered off the road onto the grassy verge and landed on its roof. The truck was found a few metres away from Dlamini’s car with damage to the driver’s side of the cabin. Banks said Dlamini’s body was found trapped inside the overturned car. The driver of the truck was not injured. It is unclear how the collision occurred, but local authorities were on the scene and investigating the incident. Friends and colleagues took to Facebook to pay their tributes to Dlamini, posting short messages on his timeline. Friend Ayanda Ngoyi posted: “Haw [sic] life is too short R.I.P. Zamani.” Sabelo Ngubane posted: “May God look after his soul and protect his loved ones”, and Mangie Tshabalala wrote: “I’m still hoping it’s not true”.
