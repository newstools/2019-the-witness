A Mkondeni woman was left traumatised after being strangled while in her car as assailants snatched her handbag from the passenger’s seat. Chanté Victor (22) was parked at a traffic light at the corner of Hoosen Haffejee (Berg) Street and West Street last Wednesday at midday when the incident happened. She told The Witness the windows on the driver’s side and passenger’s side were both slightly open. “I suddenly felt a hand around my throat and the guy was scratching the back of my neck and screaming and shouting. Another guy then pulled out my bag from the passenger’s side window.” Victor said she lost her wallet and personal documents like her driver’s licence, but her cell phone slipped out of the bag. “I then went back to work and tried to calm myself down. I went to the police station and opened a case that evening. “The windows were opened just a few centimetres. I didn’t think anyone could reach in,” she said. Victor sustained scratches to the back of her neck, and said it hurt when she ate solid food. “I threw up blood once while eating after the incident.” She said the ordeal had left her feeling broken. “I completely froze. I have pepper spray but didn’t even think to reach for it. “This has broken me down emotionally. I’m a very tough person, anyone will tell you that. But this has broken me. These guys invaded my personal space.” Victor added that no motorist had tried to assist her, and claimed a man in a bakkie behind her even hooted for her to drive when the traffic light turned green. Safe City’s Lucas Holtzhausen said the area was riddled with crime and drugs. He said Pietermaritz, East, West, and Berg streets were the hardest hit. “People must always ensure that their car doors are locked, their windows are rolled up, and they are always watching what is going on around them,” he said.
