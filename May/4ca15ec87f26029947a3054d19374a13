A former Bafana Bafana player was on Tuesday granted R1 000 bail after being charged with rape in Pietermaritzburg. The man, who may not be named as he has not yet pleaded to the charge, is alleged to have raped a colleague on April 28, at his home in the city. He was arrested on May 2, and has been in custody since then. Initially the state was opposed to him being granted bail, but on Tuesday prosecutor Mariam Aboobaker told the court that this was no longer the case. Aboobaker said that on the day of the alleged rape, the woman and some colleagues had gone to the man’s house. Their supervisor later called on them to return a vehicle, but the woman stayed behind and had a bath before falling asleep. When she woke up she found the accused on top of her having sexual intercourse. Aboobaker said the state was uncertain what the woman wanted to do. “She is uncertain if she wants to proceed with the charge or not,” she said. The woman has been unable to give a clear explanation of what happened, and “an interview with the victim is outstanding,” she said. The prosecutor read out an affidavit made by the investigating officer, Sindi-siwe Ntombela. In it, he said that the safety of the woman has been verified. The accused will be living at an alternative address because he lived close to the woman. He has no previous or pending cases. His attorney Bonisiwe Gasa said the accused intends to plead not guilty and that there had been no sexual intercourse between him and the woman. Gasa also said that although the man and woman work at the same company, they are in different departments. He will appear in court again in June.
