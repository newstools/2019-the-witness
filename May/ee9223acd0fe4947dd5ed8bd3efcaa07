A woman died and five people were injured when the car they were travelling in crashed through fencing on a bridge on Chief Albert Luthuli Street and went into the Duzi River. It is understood that the driver lost control of the Toyota Tazz, which had six occupants, and it veered off the road. Divers from the SAPS search and rescue unit spent hours on Tuesday morning combing the scene, near the YMCA building in Scottsville. During their efforts, another body from an unrelated incident was discovered floating in the Duzi. The Witness arrived on the scene at about 5.30 am yesterday to find pedestrians peering over the bridge to see the car and taking pictures of it almost fully submerged in the river. Mlungisi Mdunge, who works at the YMCA, which was open that early because of the gym it runs, said he noticed ambulances coming to the area at about 4.45 am. “I didn’t hear anything and it was all quiet outside because it was so early. But this car must have been coming from town. It’s a shock,” he said. Gym-goers were seen going to the river banks near the crash scene to have a look. Rescuers and tow truck operators had to wait some time for it to get lighter before they could extract the car and search further. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said police pulled the first three people from the vehicle, and paramedics joined them to retrieve the other three. He said the woman, believed to be in her 20s, was declared dead on scene. He said five other people had moderate injuries and were taken to hospital. While searching for more victims of this crash, rescuers discovered a body floating in the Duzi, which is thought to have been there for about two weeks. A pink handbag was also recovered from the river. The body is yet to be identified. The name of the person who died in the accident involving the car had not been released late on Tuesday.
