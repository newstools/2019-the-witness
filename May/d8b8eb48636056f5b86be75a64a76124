A Stock Theft Unit policeman died in a hail of bullets in the centre of Estcourt on Saturday night when he was ambushed by attackers who fled in his car. Constable Nkosinathi Khumalo (35), an off-duty stock theft unit police officer, was in his VW Polo vehicle in the centre of Estcourt when he was attacked by an unknown number of heavily-armed gunmen. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the constable was shot and dragged out of his car. While Naidoo said Khumalo was shot outside Emzini Lodge in Estcourt, other sources said he was killed in Alfred Street at around 7.30 pm, a very busy part of Estcourt’s CBD. The men shot the constable several times in the stomach before pulling him out of his car and leaving him dead, face-down in the middle of town. A source who asked not to be named said the attackers were “very brazen” to have hijacked the policeman at that time and place. The motive remains unknown, however, charges of murder and hijacking are being investigated by police. Khumalo’s car was traced to a smallholding in Weenen later that evening by members of the Ladysmith K9 Unit and Estcourt police. This was not confirmed by Naidoo. The source told The Witness there were between six and 10 officers at the scene and the area “was pitch black” when they arrived. “As they pulled up, they came under very heavy fire from rifles. “It must have been really heavy fire because the police had to withdraw.” The source said that the gunfire reportedly came from various directions and not just the area of the smallholding where the suspects were thought to be hiding. He said police started searching for the attackers early yesterday morning and also used a police chopper to canvass the area. A car was recovered yesterday morning, with two bullet holes in one of the front doors and the keys still in the ignition. No arrests have been made yet.
