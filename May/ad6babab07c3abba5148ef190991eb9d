Former mayor Zanele Hlatshwayo’s bodyguard, Nkosingiphile Ngubelanga, allegedly shot his wife and another man before turning the gun on himself on Monday afternoon. Ngubelanga (41) was at Imbali Unit 18 when the incident occurred. The injured victims, whose names were not released, are both in hospital in the Intensive Care Unit. Family members on Tuesday declined to comment on the shooting, saying they did not know what the circumstances were. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two counts of attempted murder and an inquest were opened at Plessislaer police station in connection with the incident. Acting Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Ngcobo said that Ngubelanga was an employee at the municipality and was a security officer in the Public Safety Unit. She said Ngubelanga was on leave when the shooting occurred. “We wish to extend our deepest condolences to the Ngubelanga family,” she said. Ngcobo had initially directed queries to Msunduzi’s security head Kwenza Khumalo. Khumalo said he would not give comment and that The Witness should talk to the family. He said The Witness should divorce the shooting from the municipality as Ngubelanga was not working when the incident took place. “I conclude that you are selfish and just want to drive your agenda for the newspaper. “I am of the view that the paper is insensitive and inhumane,” he said. He said the paper did not respect the culture of those involved. Khumalo added that municipal employees had died at the municipal offices before and no one had reported on those stories. When he was told he would be quoted he responded: “You can make it headlines if you want”.
