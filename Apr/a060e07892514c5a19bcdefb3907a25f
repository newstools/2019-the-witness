A Northdale man and his wife got the shock of their lives when a stray bullet passed through the roof and ceiling of their home, landing on his study desk at the weekend. Poobalan Padayachee said his wife, Raganie, was in the house and he was busy gardening when the bullet hit their roof at around 3.30 pm on Saturday. He said he had been mowing the lawn and heard a “pop pop pop” sound, but it sounded very far away. “A short while later my wife called me into the house and led me to the study where she had picked up the bullet from my desk and dropped it again in shock after realising what it was. She said she had heard sounds while she was inside the house and found the bullet on the desk,” said Padayachee. There was a hole on the ceiling where the bullet went through. Padayachee has kept the 9mm calibre bullet as a souvenir. He said it was “dangerous” for people to be shooting next to houses. “Mind you this bullet went through the tiles of the roof and right through the ceiling. Imagine if it had hit me while I was busy working outside in the garden. “I would have been dead. It could have even killed my dog. What were we supposed to think if we found our dog dead with a bullet in him?” Padayachee said he contacted the police, who came to his house. However, he had ended up opting not to open a case as he didn’t think it would lead to arrests. He added that police said they would look into the matter. He also reported the incident to his security company. Padayachee said he learnt from other neighbours that there were more gunshots heard on Otto’s Bluff Road near Woodlands. He was told that two bullets went through someone else’s house in Woodlands after gunshots were fired, allegedly during a funeral at the Mountain Rise cemetery. However, this could not be confirmed. Both Mountain Rise police and the provincial police had not responded to media queries sent to them by The Witness by the time of going to print yesterday.
