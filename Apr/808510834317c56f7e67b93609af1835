A Hilton couple have offered a R20 000 reward for the safe return of their missing Rottweiler, Frankie , who they regard as a family member. Frankie went missing on Friday and the owners, Josh Trenam and his wife Tyler,? are desperate to find and bring their four-year-old dog back home. Speaking to The Witness on Tuesday, Josh appealed to anyone with any information on their dog’s whereabouts to contact them at 076 784 7681 or 074 171 8592. Josh said Frankie went missing on Friday between 7.30 and 8 pm. “I think there was a malfunction with the gate and Frankie managed to get out. There is also a possibility that someone might have taken him as he never really wanders off even if we open the gate, but we don’t know. “We noticed a short while after he wandered off that he was no longer in the yard, so we drove around the neighbourhood looking for him but we couldn’t find him,” said Trenam. He said his wife is very distraught as they regarded Frankie more as their child than a dog. “Some people have children and would pay any amount of money to ensure the safe return of their children, but we don’t have children, we have Frankie. He is part of our family and is really like a son to us and that’s why we are willing to pay so much money to make sure he comes back home,” he said. Trenam described Frankie as friendly, and said he has a long tail (Rottweiler tails tend to be docked). He offered to pay the R20 000 reward to anyone who found and returned the dog unharmed. He said they have received a lot of support from the public as many people were helping them look for Frankie. The couple have reported the matter to the police.
