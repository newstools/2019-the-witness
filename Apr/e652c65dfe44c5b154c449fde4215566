A Pelham resident was delighted to take Pelham’s rescued dog, Rio, home with her on Tuesday. The cross-breed dog became well known within the Pelham community after residents rallied round to get him off the streets after he was seen roaming around the area in a visibly poor condition. Rio was finally rescued by PMB Animal Rescue & Rehome (PARR) some two weeks ago and, after undergoing veterinary treatment, has been housed at the SPCA’s boarding kennels during his quarantine period. Read: Rio set for new start On Tuesday, an excited Rosemarie du Toit said she first came to know about Rio through her WhatsApp community watch group. “I was following his story on social media and saw that after he was rescued, he was taken to the vets and was being kept at the SPCA boarding kennels. “My dog died last year, and I thought it was finally time for me to get another dog now after six months. “I love big dogs like Rio. He needs a loving home and I need a dog to look after and bond with,” said Du Toit. As a welcome home treat, Du Toit said she had cooked a lot of chicken for Rio after learning that chicken is one of his favourite meals. Tina Clarke, one of the founders of PARR, said Rio has recovered well but still has a long way to go. “We trust that being with Rosemarie is going to do very well for him,” she said. Clarke thanked the Pietermaritzburg SPCA for allowing them to house Rio at their kennels during his recovery and also thanked everyone who has donated dog food. Du Toit said she was still deciding whether she would change Rio’s name, given to him by Clarke’s six-year-old son. The alternative name she has in mind is Hobo.
