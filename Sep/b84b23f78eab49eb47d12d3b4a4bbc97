Pietermaritzburg's very own Emiles House of Hair took home two awards in creative braiding at a prestigious South African national hairstyling competition recently. The salon also took third place for the Avant Garde Division, making Emiles House of Hair the only Pietermaritzburg salon to return with awards from the annual national competition held by the EOHCB — the Employers Organisation for Hairdressing, Cosmetology and Beauty. Emiles’ Juan Holland came first nationally for creative braiding, using dainty flowers, pretty pins and silver white braids to create a “magical fairy-tale” hairstyle on his model. Holland said Emiles owner, Pam Thompson, helped him “achieve the brilliant style” and that many other salons and models complimented him on his work, saying they hadn’t seen anything like it before. “People were very impressed,” he said. Another of Emiles’ hairdressers, Shari Anderson, came second nationally for creative braiding using rose gold braids and came up with a “bow” theme. “I worked with Pam on the style and went with a bow theme. I was very excited that we were able to show our talent and showcase the salon’s abilities. I hope we made Pam proud,” she said. The salon was one of the first multi-racial salons in Pietermaritzburg, with Thompson creating unique, quality braids in colours that can only be found at her salon. “We are showcasing what we do every day at the salon. “We want people to see the hairstyles and want them to try something different,” said Rose Chengan of the salon. The third hairdresser placed was Sarah Motloung, who came third in the Avant Garde category. She based her hairstyle around the spring theme since the competition was held on September 1. Chengan added that if it were not for the support of their clients, they might not have made it to the competition, as everything was very pricey. She also thanked Irene’s models as they used models from the agency in the competition.
