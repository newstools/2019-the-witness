Mystery and unanswered questions surround the murder of a Bergville taxi boss and her daughter on Monday night. Eunice Ngcobo (53) and her daughter Mandisa Ngcobo (22) were gunned down in an apparent ambush in the Bonjaneni area. Ngcobo’s other two children survived the attack. Ngcobo owned Tugela Falls tours, transfers and accommodation and she was also the chairperson of the Bergville Taxi Association. It is believed that the family had just arrived at one of their bed and breakfast businesses in the area when unknown gunmen opened fire on their vehicle. Ngcobo’s Toyota Fortuner, which was riddled with bullets, bore silent witness to the shooting in the middle of the quiet rural area. The family declined to comment on the incident. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said two cases of murder and two cases of attempted murder were opened at the Ematsheni police station. “While entering the gate at her premises, they were accosted by unknown suspects who opened fire towards them using high calibre firearms,” said Gwala. No arrests have been made yet. Skhumbuzo Madine, Bergville Taxi Association secretary, said they were shocked by the incident. “I was told that she was shot with her children. We are all very shocked. She had never reported received threats. “Incidents of this nature are unsettling because you don’t know who is next,” said Madine. Madine said Eunice had been chairperson for three years. He described her as a successful businesswoman and leader. “She was fearless and was making positive waves in our community. “She brought tourists in the community and created employment. It’s a shame she was killed in such a heartless manner,” he said. According to the Ladysmith Herald, international tourists who were at the BnB at the time of the shooting were left shaken by the incident. — Ladysmith Herald.
