Family and friends are frantically trying to reach Alan Jennings , who missed his return flight from the United Kingdom last week and has not been heard from since August 17. Jennings, a former Estcourt and Howick resident, had been living and working in Umhlanga at the time of his disappearance. Local police are investigating and have reportedly informed Interpol that Jennings has gone missing. A source close to the investigation said Jennings was due to fly to the UK on August 17 and was then going to catch a flight to Barcelona a day later. “He checked in for the Barcelona flight but never made it onto the plane,” said the source. “No one has heard from him in two weeks and no one knows where he is or what he is doing.” The source said there was also a lot of speculation surrounding Jennings’ disappearance, and not all of it is good. “There have been various allegations about what has happened but investigations will help figure what is going on. We aren’t actually sure what is going on and if he really is missing or just travelling.” Jennings’ sister, Carol Prins, declined to comment as she was worried it might “interfere with the investigation”. While circumstances around the disappearance remain sketchy, those closest to Jennings said they hoped he would be found safe and sound. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the detective dealing with the case would only be available to give more information on the investigation later today. If anyone has any information on the whereabouts of Jennings, they should contact their nearest local police station or Warrant Officer Sidane at 082 459 7454. People can also contact the Pink Ladies at 083 378 4882.
