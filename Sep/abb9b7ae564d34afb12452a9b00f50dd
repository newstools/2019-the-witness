“The roads are a mess … We buy Quantum taxis and they only last for two years.” Those were the sentiments from Mpumuza taxi owners who say they are battling to maintain their vehicles because of the pothole-riddled Morcom Road in Prestbury. Mpumuza Taxi Association rank manager Vusi Shange said: “It’s not even potholes any more. The roads have one lane. Each car has to wait for another one to pass. We fix tyres and other parts almost every month. “In 2018, we were told that there were processes under way for this road … The road is getting worse every day,” said Shange. He said the authorities were quick to hand out fines and say taxis were not roadworthy, but the roads were the reason the taxis were not in a good condition. “I receive complaints from the drivers every day. Some of the roads have ditches which have become holes. One could bury a cat or a dog in the holes. “Taxis cannot use some of these roads. They must bring at least a grader … to fix these roads while we wait for their empty promises,” he said. Shange said to try and avoid the potholed road, taxi drivers were now forced to drive into the oncoming traffic lane. “It’s dangerous but drivers don’t have a choice. We have been waiting for over two years and the municipality is failing to fix this road. “It’s very surprising because even municipal officials use this road yet none of them have bothered to bring this issue up in council,” he said. Msunduzi did not respond to a query sent by The Witness on Monday.
