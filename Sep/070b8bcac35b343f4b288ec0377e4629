Over 600 title deeds have been handed to residents of Imbali and Ambleton Farm by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala. The handover was made through the Human Settlements Department’s Title Deed Restoration Programme (TRP) that will be rolled out to provide security of tenure for many beneficiaries across the province. “The event allowed us to ensure that 636 people become fully-fledged, legal homeowners. The handover is yet another clear demonstration of the KwaZulu-Natal government’s commitment to restoring dignity and creating a better life for the people of this province,” said Zikalala. The 636 beneficiaries are from areas including Imbali Unit BB, AA and Ambelton Farm. Esther Zalisa (73) said: “I feel very happy and I would like to thank the premier for giving me my title deed. I will never forget this day, as this is truly a special day and this property is for me and my family.” Another beneficiary, Ntombizonke Nene, said she had waited about 19 years to get her title deed. “At long last I’m a homeowner. I have three children and I’m happy that they finally have a place to call home. I was always anxious that in case something happened to me my children would be left displaced,” said Nene. Zikalala said the Human Settlements Department was busy with phase 2 of the Imbali title deed project, and more people would become homeowners when it was completed. He warned people not to hand over their title deeds when borrowing money from loan sharks. “These houses must be passed down from generation to generation. ... There are many people who have lost their houses [to loan sharks]. No loan shark has a right to take your house away.
