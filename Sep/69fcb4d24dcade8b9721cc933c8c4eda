When schools re-open on Tuesday and pupils at Phangindawo Primary School in Elandskop reunite, the desk where Phila Ngcobo sat will be empty. Phila (10), a Grade 5 pupil from Elandskop, was killed in a freak accident on Zwartkop Road on Tuesday afternoon. It is believed that Phila fell off a moving bakkie and died on impact after suffering serious head injuries. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said a case of culpable homicide was opened and is being investigated. Phila, who had been visiting relatives in the Mpumuza area in Edendale, had travelled with a neighbour to town and they were returning to the area when the accident happened. Speaking to The Witness on Wednesday, his grandfather, Bafana Mngadi, said Phila was with his friends when the accident happened. The bakkie belongs to a neighbour. A source said the neighbour was on his way into the CDB to fetch his daughter from school. The children had allegedly wanted to go for a ride-along and the young boy fell out of the bakkie near the Botanical Gardens. “All we know is that Phila and his friends had asked to accompany the neighbour who was going to fetch someone in town. “We only found out about the accident late on Tuesday. We don’t know what really happened because the driver is still too distraught to talk about the incident,” said the grandfather. He added: “When we arrived at the Prestbury police station, the police broke the news. It was so difficult, I had to hold off telling his mother until we got home.” Mngadi described Phila as a playful and quiet boy, who enjoyed playing soccer.
