A local woman has complained about the treatment she received from Mountain Rise police officers saying their “uncaring, rude attitude” is the reason people do not want to open cases. Mountain Rise police station will be investigating complaints against the allegedly ill-behaved officers who reportedly ignored the woman when she came to report a car accident early on Saturday morning. The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said she had went to the station at 7 am on Saturday. “I went inside and there were three officers behind a desk and two behind the counter. I stood by the counters waiting to be helped but no one approached me,” said the woman. “After standing there for a while, I walked up to one of the officers and asked if he could help and jokingly said ‘I hope you are in a good mood’. “The officer said he wasn’t in a good mood because he was working on a Saturday and then just walked away from me. “I was so disgusted and distressed. Eventually I just shouted: Will anyone help me?” The woman said a man then approached her and directed her to a woman who was in a different section of the office who dealt with car accidents. “She cannot be seen from the front. I did not know she was there. She was very nice and helpful but the way the officers at the front made me feel was terrible. “This is why people do not like to report cases. It is like no one cares,” she said. Mountain Rise station commander Brigadier Boxer Pillay said the officers behaviour “is absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated”. “This is not the way police are trained to deal with people. We will be investigating the matter and will be talking to the woman to take a statement and get a letter of complaint from her,” he said.
